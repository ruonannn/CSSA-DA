"""End-to-end guards for the CSS-15 retrieval logging contract.

Two of the issue's acceptance criteria cannot be checked from a unit test
of the adapter alone, because they are properties of a whole request:

1. the stage logs and the access log carry the *same* `request_id`, and
2. no user content reaches the formatted output.

Both hold today only because `RequestContextMiddleware` binds a ContextVar
that `AppJsonLogFormatter` reads back out. Nothing in the adapter's own
tests would notice if that link broke -- if `/v1/chat` became `async def`
with the pipeline handed to an executor, or if `bind_request_id` moved,
the logs would keep being emitted and would silently stop being joinable.

These tests assert on the *formatted JSON* rather than on LogRecord
attributes, so they cover the formatter and its STRUCTURED_FIELDS
whitelist too.
