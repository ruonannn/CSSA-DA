# horizontal scaling (see docs/roadmap/ROADMAP_platform.md).
# INVARIANT: the per-IP and site-wide counters live in process memory.
# Dockerfile.api runs ONE uvicorn worker and docker-compose ONE replica, so
# they are truly global today — adding --workers N, compose replicas, or
# extra ECS tasks silently multiplies every effective limit by N. Switch to
# a Redis storage_uri before scaling out.
